This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using Python and the libraries Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow working in a Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of this project was to predict the success of charity funding candidates using a neural network model. Charity funding candidate data, including whether the funding was successfully used, was provided in the form of a CSV. The CSV was read into a Pandas dataframe and then several preprocessing steps were necessary including dropping uneeded columns, binning rare values for certain columns as "other", transforming categorical data to numeric with get_dummies, scaling the data, separating target from features, and splitting into training and test data. Next, a neural network was devised, compiled, trained, and tested. Poor performance of this initial model indicated a need to make adjustments to optimize the model. Optimization attempts included changing the preprocessing to reduce the number of features, changing the number of units per model layer, changing the number of layers, and changing the activation function used in the hidden layers. Despite these attempts, the model still performed relatively poorly and the next logical step might be to try a different type of machine learning model, such as a simple logistic regression model.
